			<h2>HARDSHELL REVIEW</h2>
			
			<p>Hardshell is an upscale seafood and steak restaurant with 2 locations in Richmond:  Shockoe Slip and Belgrade. We went to the Belgrade restaurant for a famiy birthday celebration and had a wonderful time.</p>
			<p>Since I'm a blue cheese fanatic, I had to start with the wedge salad. The blue cheese was wonderful, close to what I make myself. For appetizers, we split the calimari and crab dip. Both were perfectly prepared. Being a seafood lover, for the entree I had to get the Hardshell Pasta, which has shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, and a lobster tail in a slightly spicy tomato sauce with linguine. It was slightly spicy but not too much, esepcailly since I like things very spicy  A wonderful dish with a great tasting of different seafoods.  My father got the filet which came with whipped potatoes and asparagus. The only complaint is that, like most restaurants, the asparagus is too thick making them a bit tough at the ends.  Restaurants need to learn that thicker asparagus is not better. For desert, being a cheesehead, I had to go for the cheesecake.  It was a perfect ending to a great meal.</p>
			<p>The service throughout the meal was warm and attentive.  Overall, the food and service were certainly what you look for in a high-end restaurant.  I would certainly recommend Hardshell for anyone looking for a high-end steak and seafood restaurant.  It is certainly worth visiting again.</p>
