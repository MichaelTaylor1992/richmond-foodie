			<h2>AMIGOS FAMILY RESTAURANT REVIEW</h2>
			
			<p>I went to Amigos Family Restaurant with a friend for lunch.  It is an authentic Mexican restaurant on Staples Mill Road in Richmond.  Like many Mexican restaurants, they start with chips and salsa.  For lunch I had the chilaquiles.  I’ve had chilaquiles quite a few times on the west coast, but they are not easy to find in Richmond so it was great to find them at a local restaurant.  They were quite good, on par with the chilaquiles I’d had in California.  The menu is very extensive so it will take more visits to explore all the options they offer.  I do look forward to returning in the future.</p>
