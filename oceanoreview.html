			<h2>OCEANO RESTAURANT REVIEW</h2>
			
			<p>Oceano is a new restaurant in Sycamore Square in Midlothian.  It opened in the space which had been occupied by Crab Louie’s Tavern for over 30 years.  Oceano is run by the owners of Maya Restaurant in Richmond.  Like Crab Louie’s before, it focuses on seafood.  However, it draws it’s influences from the coastal cuisines of Spain and Italy.</p> 
			<p>We first went during its cold opening when it had a more limited menu.  But the paella was incredible.   The portion was enormous and the shrimp and scallops were fresh and flavorful.  In fact, the paella from Oceano is used as the background picture of Richmondfoodie.  I started with the ceviche which was another great dish, loaded with seafood.  My father is not a seafood person, but the NY Strip was a hit as well.</p>
			<p>We’ve returned several times and every time the food has been amazing, the service has been attentive and gracious.  With the closing of Pescados nearby, having a restaurant like Oceano is a very welcome addition to the Midlothian area dining scene and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful evening out.
