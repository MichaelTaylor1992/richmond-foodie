			<h2>SIAM PARAGAON REVIEW</h2>
			
			<p>I had never been to a Thai restaurant before, so my trip to Siam Paragon was quite an experience. I started with the Kanom Jeep dumplings. They were good, filled with pork, shrimp, crab and water chestnuts. I didn’t use the soy sauce. However, next came the Poh Tack soup, and it was very spicy. I love spicy food (I keep jars of hot sauce in my refrigerator) but I wasn’t really ready for how spicy it was. But it wasn’t as what was to come. Next was the sea war salad, which was full of wonderful seafood. This wasn’t very spicy, but filled with shrimp, scallops, squid and mussels.</p> 
			<p>However, next came the drunken noodles and I wasn’t ready. It had 3 peppers on the menu to warn you. It should have had a lot more than 3. It was good, but boy it was spicy. My mother had the pad woon sen, which was much tamer. For desert I had the crispy banana a la mode which helped my mouth cool down and was a perfect ending to the meal.</p>

			<p>I certainly look forward to trying Siam Paragon again. I’ll just need to be aware of how truly spicy some of the food can be.</p>
