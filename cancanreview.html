			<h2>CAN CAN BRASSERIE REVIEW</h2>
			
			<p>Can Can Brasserie is the only true French bistro in Richmond. I admit to a bit of apprehension going because of a bad experience with french food before. But we had a wonderful experience at Can Can.  Sadly, I didn't get as many pictures as I normally would.</p>
			<p>I started with the escargot and they were amazing.  They certainly aren't for everyone but being a seafood lover, they were perfect for me.  The garic butter was perfect.  And the bread that came with dinner was perfect for getting every bit of the garlic butter. Everyone at the table at the French onion soup.  It was layered in an incredible amount of cheese and the onion soup had great flavor.  It would be perfect on a cold night.</p>
			<p>For the entree, I had the seared scallops and they were perectly prepared.  They were large and tasty.  My father had the traditional steak frites.  A large NY strip was perfectly prepared. And the frites were perfectly prepared - crispy on the outside and tender and chewy on the inside.</p>
			<p>We decided to skip dessert this time since we were heading across the street to Kilwins for some candy and ice cream, but next time we'll be sure to try some of the dessert.  But overall, Can Can certainly made me fall in love with French food and I can't wait to go back again.  I'd certainly recommend going for anyone who wants to try a true French bistro in town.</p>
