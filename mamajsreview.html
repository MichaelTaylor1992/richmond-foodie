			<h2>MAMA J'S KITCHEN REVIEW</h2>
			
			<p>Mama J's Kitchen has been an anchor of the Jackson Ward restaurant scene for almost 15 years. Velma Johnson, Mama J, has created a true soul food mecca for both locals and visitors to Richmond. Consistently voted as one of the best restaurants in Richmond, it is a must for anyone who wants to know great soul food.</p>
			<p>Fried chicken is always a must for me. The entrees include fried and baked chicken, pork chops, catfish and other soul food staples. Sides include her amazing mac and cheese, greens, mashed potatos and potato salad. However, one of the highlights is always the desert. If you see a cake you like when you enter, you might want to make sure you have the waitstaff hold it for you because it might not be there when you get to desert. The apple or peach cobbler is dense and amazing as well.</p>
			<p>You can always expect a wait since Mama's doesn't take reservations, but the wait can be fun because everyone is always friendly and talking with guests from other parts of the country who are frequently visitors is a great way to pass the time</p>
			<p>Mama J's is an anchor for a reason. Consistently great food in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. It is a must for both locals and visitors alike.</p>
