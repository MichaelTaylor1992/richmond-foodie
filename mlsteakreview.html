			<h2>ML STEAK RESTAURANT REVIEW</h2>
			
			<p>ML Steak Modern Chophouse is the seventh restaurant from Mike and Kim Lindsey. Owner/chef of such restaurants as Lillie Pearl, Buttermilk and Honey, Bully Burger and Jubilee, this is their interpretation of the modern chophouse. Recently opened in the old Fatty Smokes building on East Broad Street, it combines some of influences of Lindsey's other restaurants to create a modern chophouse feel.</p>
			<p>On our visit, we tried the the filet which we had with both their mashed potatoes and french fries. The steak was perfectly cooked. The mashed potatoes were good but the french fries were some of the best I've had in a long time. In addition to the traditional filet, they also offer a filet flight, offering 3 smaller filets with 3 differetn toppings - a very unusual idea. My guest tried the half smoked fried chicken. They use the remaining smoker left over from Fatty Smokes, use the batter similar to the Buttermilk and Honey restaurant batter and create a unique, wonderful taste. Served on a cutting board with their mac and cheese and collards, it was great.
			</p>
			<p>Overall, ML Steak is a great addition to the Richmond restaurant scene. Most chophouses in town are traditional, and a bit stuffy. ML Steak achieves its goal of a modern chophouse, casual but upscale at the same time. I'm looking forward to repeated visits. I'd highly recommend it.
