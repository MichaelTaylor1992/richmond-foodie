			<h2>SUGAR'S CRAB SHACK REVIEW</h2>
			
			<p>Sugar's Crab Shack is a shack. A concrete shack, but a shack. There is no indoor dining, just a few outside concrete tables for eating. It is mostly for takeaway. But what it offers is amazing seafood as good as anywhere in the city.</p>
			
			<p>Sugar's is owned by the group that owns Croaker's Spot. Everything is cooked to order.  One running joke at Sugar's is that they seem to have a math problem. The pictures I show is their 3 piece fish (which was at least 7-8 pieces) and their 5 piece oyster basket (which was at leat 10 oysters). Their portions are always generous, in the true tradition of soul.  They offer shrimp, whiting, catfish, soft shell crab among other seafood. Their sides are always on-spot as well.</p>
			
			<p>You can expect to a line to order because it is popular because it is so good. But I've never been there when everyone in line wasn't talking with each other. The customers are always friendly and helpful.</p>
			
			<p>Sugar's is one of my favorite places in town, especially on a nice day outside. If you love great seafood, it is highly recommended.</p>
